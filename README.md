### How to check:
* Please open index.html. No installations are needed, all vendor libraries & frameworks are placed in vendor/ folder.
* Only if Sass compiling is needed, please run npm install , & npm run sassy

### Some notes:
* Decided not to use a Bundler and keep it simple by only adding Node Sass.
* Since no Bundlers are used, thought this simple folder structure would be better for this specific task.
* Using Bootstrap v4.6.1
* Added the font `Sofia Pro` as locally hosted WOFF2 just for testing purposes.
* Lazy loading is added only as loading=lazy. No external libraries are used as of yet.

Thank you!

The Figma design is beautiful, btw. :)


### To further improve, nice to have the following features:
* Touch events support.
* More dynamic approach to handle different screen sizes and slide counts.

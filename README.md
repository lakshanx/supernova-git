### How to check:
* No installations are needed, all vendor libraries/frameworks are placed in vendor/ folder.
* Only if Sass compiling is needed, please run npm install , & npm run sassy

### Some notes:
* Decided not to use a Bundler and keep it simple by only adding sass.
* Since no Bundlers are used, thought this simple folder structure would be better for this specific task.
